# Node.js Express App

This is a simple Node.js application using the Express framework. The application provides routes for tracking and counting operations. It also connects to a Redis database for data storage.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Redis: [Download Redis](https://redis.io/download)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm init
   npm install express
   npm install redis
   npm install jest
   npm install supertest
   ```

3. Configure the application:
   Copy the config/config.js.example file to config/config.js and update the configuration as needed.

   ```bash
   cp config/config.js.example config/config.js
   ```

   Update the values in config/config.js with your Redis configuration.

## Running the Application

    Run the following command to start the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will start on the configured port, and you should see a message indicating that the app is listening on that port.
